1.  Introduction

   The flexible grid (flexi-grid) optical network technology defined by
   the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and documented in Recommendation ITU-
   T_G.694.1 [ITU-T_G.694.1] and ITU-T_G.872 [ITU-T_G.872] provides an
   enhanced Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by
   defining a set of nominal central frequencies, slot widths, and the
   concept of the "frequency slot".  This technology increases both
   transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing the
   optimization of bandwidth usage.

   [RFC7698] provides a framework for GMPLS-Based control of flexi-grid
   DWDM networks while [RFC7699] defines generalized labels for the use
   of GMPLS in flexi-grid networks.

   [RFC8363] provides extensions to the OSPF-TE protocol so as to
   support GMPLS control of flexi-grid networks.

   This document presents a YANG data model [RFC7950] for flexi-grid
   objects in the dynamic optical network, including nodes, transponders
   and links, as well as how such links interconnect nodes.  This model
   is independent of control plane protocols.

   This document identifies the flexi-grid components, parameters, and
   their values.  It characterizes the features and the performances of
   the flexi-grid elements.  For this, it augments [RFC8795], and
   imports the generic Layer 0 types and use of "media-channel" defined
   in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

   An application example in Section 4 is also provided to better
   understand the utility of this YANG model.

   A partner document defines a second YANG module that described flexi-
   grid tunnels, i.e., the paths from source to destination through a
   number of intermediate nodes [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-tunnel-yang].

   Impairment-aware traffic engineering topology is described in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang].

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

4.  Example of Use

   In order to explain how this model is used, we provide the following
   example.  An optical network usually has multiple transponders,
   switches (nodes) and links.  Figure 1 shows a simple topology.

        +----------+                                        +----------+

                        Figure 1: Topology Example

   In order to configure a flexi-grid network to interconnect
   transponders A and E, first of all we have to populate the flexi-grid
   topology YANG model with all elements in the network:

   *  We define the transponders within nodes A and E as tunnel
      termination points (TTPs) and provide their internal local link
      connectivity towards the node interfaces.  We also provide the
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces of nodes A and B.

   *  We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   *  Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes,
      indicating which flexi-grid labels are available.

   *  Other information, such as the slot frequency and granularity are
      also provided.

5.  YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Topology

5.1.  Flexi-Grid Topology Data Model Overview

   This document describes the data model for flexi-grid topology.  As a
   classic traffic engineering (TE) technology, flexi-grid provides WDM
   switching in transport network.  Therefore the YANG module presented
   in this document augments from a more generic TE network topology
   data model, i.e., the ietf-te-topology, as specified in [RFC8795],
   following the guidelines provided in section 6 of [RFC8795].

   Common types, identities, and groupings defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis] are reused in this document.

   The figure below shows the augmentation relationship between YANG
   models.

                           +-------------------------+
              TE generic   |    ietf-te-topology     |
                           +-------------------------+
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        | Augments
                                        |
                           +------------+-------------+
              Flexi-Grid   | ietf-flexi-grid-topology |
                           +--------------------------+

      Figure 2: Relationship between Flexi-Grid and TE topology models

   The entities and TE attributes, such as node, termination points and
   links, are still applicable for describing a flexi-grid topology and
   the model presented in this document only specifies the technology-
   specific attributes/information.

   The flexi-grid specific attributes and label format is defined in
   [RFC7699], including the grid type, nominal central frequency
   granularity, slot width granularity, n and m parameters.  A
   collection of common data types have also been specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis], and used in this document for
   augmentation of the generic TE topology model.

   The YANG module ietf-flexi-grid-topology defined in this document
   conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   defined in [RFC8342].

5.2.  Augmentations for Flexi-Grid Topology and Node

   There are a few characteristics augmenting to the generic TE
   topology.

   Following the guidelines in [RFC8795], a flexi-grid-topology network-
   type is specified as the indicator of flexi-grid in the topology as
   shown in Figure 3.

       augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology:
         +--rw flexi-grid-topology!

              Figure 3: Flexi-Grid Topology Augmentation

   A flexi-grid-node presence container is specified, augmenting the
   generic TE node attributes, to indicate that the TE node is a Flexi-
   Grid node as shown in Figure 4.

             augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te
                     /tet:te-node-attributes:
               +--rw flexi-grid-node!

                   Figure 4: Flex-Grid Node Augmentation

   It is assumed that all the flexi-grid nodes are reconfigurable.

5.3.  Bandwidth Augmentation

   No bandwidth augmentations are needed for this YANG module.

   As described in Section 4.2 of [RFC7699], there is some overlap
   between bandwidth and label in Layer 0.

   The flexi-grid label resource information described in Section 5.4,
   is sufficient to also describe the spectrum resources within a flexi-
   grid network.  Therefore, the model does not define any augmentation
   for the te-bandwidth containers defined in [RFC8795].

5.4.  Label Augmentation

   The model augments all the occurrences of the label-restriction list
   in [RFC8795] with flexi-grid technology specific attributes using the
   flexi-grid-label-range-info grouping defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

   Moreover, following the guidelines in [RFC8795], the model augments
   all the occurrences of the te-label container with the flexi-grid
   technology specific attributes using the flexi-grid-label-start-end,
   flexi-grid-label-hop and flexi-grid-label-step groupings defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

       "This YANG module defines a topology model for flexi-grid
        optical networks. The model augments the technology-agnostic
        TE topology model with flexi-grid technology specific
        definitions, based on RFC 7698 and RFC 7699.

        The model fully conforms to the Network Management Datastore

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.  The
   NETCONF Protocol SSH [RFC6242] describes a method for invoking and
   running NETCONF within a SSH session as an SSH subsystem.  The
   Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides
   the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users
   to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true").  These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assigned a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688] as follows:

            URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-flexi-grid-topology
            Registrant Contact: The IESG
            XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.
