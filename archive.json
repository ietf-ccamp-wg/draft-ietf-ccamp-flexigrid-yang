As you see, it is divided in the same sections of the document so that it is easier to find the issues.\r\n\r\nAnything I get wrong, please let me know\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n## 1 Introduction\r\n* ITU recommendations should be cite in a consistent way, i.e. instead of `G.694.1 [G.694.1] and G.872 [G.872]`, it should be `[G.694.1] and [G.872]`, the same way we cite RFCs or drafts.\r\n\r\n* Typo `flexi-grid elements..`\r\n\r\n## 3 Tree diagram\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Prefixes in Data Node Names\r\n\r\n* Should caption of the table be `Table 1:...` instead of `Figure 1:...`?\r\n\r\n## 4 Example of use\r\n\r\n* We should only keep the second version of the figure instead of both of them. \r\n\r\n* Reference in text should be `Figure 2` in this version, but as I pointed out in 3.1, maybe Figure 1 should be Table and this closes this issue.\r\n\r\n## 6 Yang code \r\n\r\n* In contact leaf, Dan's email is not the same of section Authors' Addresses. (Not an issue but a piece of information for Dan in case he didn't notice).\r\n\r\n* I think that should change the reference and description and use `RFC YYYY` instead of `RFC XXXX`. We have in section 3.1 this note \r\n\r\n```\r\nRFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the RFC numbers assigned to\r\ndraft-ietf-ccamp-layer0-types.  Please replace YYYY with the RFC\r\nnumber assigned to this document.  Please remove this note.\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in the yang code this note\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX; see\r\nthe RFC itself for full legal notices.\";\r\n\r\nrevision 2020-10-21 {\r\ndescription\r\n    \"Initial Version\";\r\nreference\r\n    \"RFC XXXX: A YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Optical Networks\";\r\n// RFC Ed.: replace XXXX with actual RFC number, update date\r\n// information and remove this note\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not a big issue but something kind to the RFC Editors so that they can replace XXXX with RFC number for layer0-types and YYYY with our document's number :)\r\n\r\n* Only validation warning is the one I pointed out in last meeting (solved in layer-0-types)\r\n\r\n## 7 Security considerations\r\n\r\n* `Secure Shell (SSH)` is used there three times. Should we just expand the first time? Maybe keep the ones that are titles of RFCs?  Also, should we expand TLS or is already well-known?\r\n\r\n## 9 Contributors\r\n\r\n* Daniel Michaud's corporative email should be `daniel.michaud@estudiante.uam.es` but it is probably already disabled. Jorge should confirm this.\r\n\r\n* Maybe, for consistency, we should ask Victor and Oscar to have also their second surname as Jorge and I do. Or remove our second surname. It's not such a big deal in any case and should be left to each one's discretion.\r\n\r\n* Italo's affiliation (Huawei) is not the same as Haomian's (Huawei Technologies). (Maybe they are different companies and I am messing this up, my apologies in advance in that case :) )\r\n\r\n## 11 References\r\n\r\n### 11.1 Normative references\r\n\r\n* `Madrid, U.` should be `Lopez de Vergara, J. E.`\r\n\r\n* `Lopezalvarez, V` should be `Lopez, V.` (or `Lopez-Alvarez, V.`)\r\n\r\n* `Dios, O.` should be `Gonzalez de Dios, O.`\r\n\r\n### 11.2 Informative references\r\n\r\n* `ITUT` should be `ITU-T`\r\n-------------------------------------",

This is almost what I want the caveat being that it returns true if any of the predicates - e.g. primary-path, route-object-exclude-object, etc -  has the value  in question but I believe that that will never be the case.\r\n\r\nIn which case,\r\n when \"ancestor::node()/nw:network-types/tet:te-topology\"\r\nas proposed by Lada will do the job for almost all the 'when' statements (and I can understand it ).\r\n\r\nThe thread is on the netmod WG list from 29dec21 under the subject\r\nYANG 'when' with absolute path\r\n\r\nTom Petch",

IMHO, the aggregation (multiplexing) of client layer signals is performed by muxponders and not by transponders. A muxponder can be modelled as a layer 1 functionality providing the aggregation (multiplexing) of client layer signals and a transponder functionality. In this case, I agree that the aggregation (multiplexing) of client layer signals is outside the scope of this document.\r\n\r\nI do not recall if these issues have been all addressed in the 3R model (need to double check).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to keep the text as it is now and to track this as an issue for discussion after IETF 112.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @italobusi in https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/94#discussion_r734500969_",

We feel a new approach (YANG model) may be required to address the requirements for mixed technology environments. Furthermore, we have highlighted these requirements in key uses (Slides) documented in the following GitHub issue (57):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang/issues/57\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, a solution may require a new single modular optical model that can be used for multiple technologies, or a new layer-0 optical model with extended capabilities for specific higher-layer technologies, or adapting the existing work-in-progress models. We have not decided which solution to pursue and will seek consensus from the current authors and the wider CCAMP community.\r\n\r\nWe will provide a more detailed update during the CCAMP session at IETF 116, including the following:\r\n\r\n1.            A summary of the technology impacted, requirements and use cases\r\n2.            Which documents are affected?\r\n3.            How to address the requirements and use cases, single modular model or multiple new/updated models? \r\n4.            What do we intend to do with the affected documents (modify or start a new I-D)?\r\n5.            Provide an overview of the new (or modified) YANG model(s) to address the requirements and use case scenarios\r\n6.            Propose a sequence of actions\r\n\r\nDuring the IETF 116 CCAMP meeting, we hope to receive feedback from the wider CCAMP community. \r\n\r\nBR, Dan (on behalf of the Flexi-Grid discussion participants).  \r\n<<",

I put comment along the file.\r\n\r\nA question for clarification on the first point, are we looking for 'why to add' or 'what to be added'? I am preferring the latter as it makes sense to explain how the augmentation is done and what can be achieved by providing guidances. To answer 'why' it's a problem more to generic TE models, not tech-specific models. \r\n\r\nI agree that we should give more explicit descriptions. The proper place is in this model, not in ietf-layer0-types. Once we confirm which grouping should be used, we need to indicate those leaf/list/container usage in the description section of this model. ",

But for example flexgrid frequency slot , as reported in RFC7698, is defined by  nominal central frequency and slot width, while here is reported flex-grid-frequency-slot as  just M value for slot-width, that is misleading. We can take into account in l0-types-ext draft to define better the usage of all these groupings.",
