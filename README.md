# A YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Optical Networks

## Scope

This repository is to facilitate the work on the [CCAMP TEAS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ccamp/documents/) WG Internet-Draft, "A YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Optical Networks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang/)".

## Abstract

   This document defines a YANG module for managing flexi-grid optical
   networks.  The model defined in this document specifies a flexi-grid
   traffic engineering database that is used to describe the topology of
   a flexi-grid network.  It is based on and augments existing YANG
   models that describe network and traffic engineering topologies.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
